            <h3>Why did I choose Computer Science as one of my GCSEs?</h3>
            <p>I chose Computer Science as one of my GCSEs because Computer Science opens up a lot of job opportunities as developers are highly sought after and also because I programme outside of school in Python and Javascript.</p>
            <h3>What other GCSE subjects did I choose and why?</h3>
            <p>I also chose to do Design and Technology as one of my GCSEs because I want to open up as many job opportunities in engineering fields as I can because that is what I am passionate about.</p>
            <h3>What am I hoping to achieve by studying Computer Science?</h3>
            <p>I am hoping to learn more about programming languages I already know a bit of and learn more programming languages. I am also hoping to learn more about the computer and components of the computer.</p>
            <h3>What was I good at in Computer Science in KS3 and what do I want to improve in KS4?</h3>
            <p>I was good at creating databases on Microsoft Access and I was good with using the Google Suite. What I want to improve this year is my understanding of how a computer works.</p>
